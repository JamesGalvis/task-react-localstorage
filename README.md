# First version
Implemented the use of localstorage for data storage in the browser, so as not to lose the created tasks when the page is closed or reloaded.

# Second version (soon)
Implemented useContext with react for proper data handling inside the program.

# Third version (on hold)
Replace tables by TasksList components, which will render Task components, for a better visualization of tasks.
